        question: "I ORDERED TOO MANY COOKIES!  HOW DO I STORE THEM?",
        answer: `Cookies should be stored in an airtight container.  They'll last several days in the cookie jar. 
        But if you find yourself in a situation where you have a stockpile of cookies, we recommend freezing your extra cookies. 
        Just reheat them in the oven for 1 minute at 350 F for a tasty treat.`
